I'm currently writing this while I ride the Carolinian 79, a train running from Raleigh Union Station, NC to Charlotte, NC.
By car, this is a drive that takes approximately 2 hours 29 minutes and covers 168 miles. 
<br/>
**Assuming no delays, the Carolinian does it in 3 hours 26 minutes. For a negligible price of $27 for a one-way ticket.**
<br/>
This *should* be a no-brainer for anyone who isn't suffering from a severe case of Car Brain (tm). 
For an extra hour of your time, and a little over the price of gas (assuming your car has decent fuel economy), you can sit in a nice spacious air-conditioned rail car,
and be whisked from Raleigh to Charlotte, without having to touch the god-forsaken interstates. And if you've ever driven in Charlotte, you understand *exactly* what I'm talking about when I call those interstates death traps.
Driving in Charlotte, no, around Charlotte in general is *Very Scary*, especially once you touch I-85. And don't get me started on I-77 or I-485 or I-277. Those highways are death traps, especially with
the number of driver(s) who drive impaired in some form (whether it be alcohol, marijuana, or general tiredness).
<br/>
And that extra hour is relatively negligible. In the time that I'm on the train, I can take a quick nap, catch up on some work, or just Generally do Something Other Than Focus On Not Dying At the Wheel Of A 2-Ton Metal Box.
You can't really do that while you're driving. Or, well, you can try. I dare you to try it and see just how well that ends (note: I do not take any responsibility if you crash).
<br/>
What's actually astounding is that this level of service is even remotely possible even with how actively crippled Amtrak is. This line is using only diesel locomotives on mostly single-track rails constructed in the early 1900s, which Amtrak shares (see: forced to share) with freight rail. Imagine if this corridor was fully
double-tracked & fully electrified. Not even going as far as establishing a new HSR (high-speed rail) service (but I can keep dreaming on), but rather merely just improving & expanding the existing tracks. The increased mobility would truly enable North Carolina to have two functioning interconnected capital cities - a feat that not many other states can claim. 
<br/>
**Amtrak is truly impressive - not in the quality of service that it provides, but how it's persevered in spite of the intense opposition it sees from from the automobile industry & freight rail industry.**
Everything that I know about US politics should mean that Amtrak should be dead, yet it perseveres.
Amtrak is not even close to being the best rail service I've used, nor do I claim that it is the best. But there is so much potential, and I'll be damned if I'm not impressed with how functional it is so far.

## Problems with Amtrak
### Frequent delays / cancellations
It would be intellectually dishonest of me if I tried to sit here and claim that Amtrak is a perfect service.
It's not, and it's pretty far from it. One of the biggest issues with Amtrak is that it regularly sees severe delays & cancellations, beyond what's normal for a public service.
And I agree that it is a severe issue, as it makes it entirely impossible to predict when you'll get to your destination, and acts as one of the biggest barriers against wider adoption.
Not everyone is a student like me, with no children nor pets to speak of, and loads of free time to spend. My circumstances make travelling on Amtrak viable, but completely unviable for the majority of Americans.
However, the story quickly gets complicated when we try to delve into *why* Amtrak is so unreliable.
<br/>
Digging into some statistics, we see just how atrocious Amtrak's on-time performance is. According to figures released by Amtrak [^1], only 8 of 42 Amtrak services have an on-time performance above 80%.
This is worse than even the worst-performing airline in the US, which is Allegiant Air at 71.33% on-time [^2].
As previously stated, this is absolutely atrocious. How can you rely on something if there's a (at worst) 81% chance that you'll arrive later than intended, if at all?

**Simple answer: you don't, which has been the answer for many Americans.**
<br/>
Unfortunately, this one can't be chocked up to pure incompetence & inefficiencies due to bureaucracy, as some would like to claim.
As I hinted to before, Amtrak shares a large portion of it's tracks with freight rail. And according to federal law, Amtrak *has* a higher priority to use these railroads over freight trains [^3].
However, Amtrak itself has no right to enforce this priority - Amtrak was found to have no right to regulate the railroads that *it* operates on [^4], 
and that only the Department of Justice can sue other freight rail operators for violating this preference [^5]. Which it has only done once in 1979 [^6].
<br/>
So, of course, freight operators step on Amtrak all the time, and dispatch their trains without regard to Amtrak's passenger service, resulting in **1.1 million minutes of delays in 2022** [^1].
Because why would they yield to Amtrak, when they know that they will not be punished for not doing so? We live in a world of incentives; the study of economics is often cited as the study of the
most effective incentives. And freight rail operators are heavily incentivized to *not* yield to Amtrak, as that would impact their freight rail services, and lead to overall lower profits & a reduced quality of service.
Why play with others in the sandbox when we could have it all for ourselves?
This is simply just the free market at work, ladies and gentlemen, and the god-awful system that we've condemned ourselves to.
**The tragedy of the commons is a practical joke, as that suggests a time where corporations were fueled by anything other than greed & excess, and acted in anything other than in their direct self-interest.**
<br/>
Unfortuately, our daily lives are *enabled* by this system, and there's no destroying it any time soon (but that won't stop me from trying).
So, we have to learn to play their game, and just be better at it. I'll get into some of these proposed solutions later.
<br/>

### Rapidly aging infrastructure
Amtrak was established in 1971 - over *52* years ago. Until very recently, railroad infrastructure spend has remained relatively constant in stark contrast to overall infrastructure spend [^7]. 
And that lack of allocation has measurable effects: in 1995, the number of underground railroad tunnels that were in poor condition was 18%. In 2014, that number jumped to *65%* [^7]. Over half of all railroad tunnels
are in *poor* condition. And we have just barely begun to repair any of these tunnels or bridges, as Amtrak currently has a repair backlog of *$45.2 billion* dollars [^8].
As an example of just how widespread this problem is, take the Northeast Corridor, which is considered to be Amtrak's money maker / the corridor that tends to subsidize every other Amtrak service.
The Northeast Corridor has bridges and tunnels that are over 100 years old,
which have not seen any major repair / overhaul since they were initially constructed [^9].
<br/>
Needless to say, this is *terrifying*. But this tends to reflect a general trend in the United States where infrastructure spending is de-prioritized until it
wrecks havok: see the 2021 Texas power grid failure for one of the shining examples of this.
